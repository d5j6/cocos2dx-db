cocos2dx-db
===========
A FMDB C++ implementation for cocos2d-x, migrated from WiEngine code. It provides a user-friendly interface to 
interact with sqlite3 database.

Requirement
===========
cocos2dx-db project refers cocos2d-x project. You must clone cocos2d-x repository to a folder named "cocos2d-x", 
and then clone cocos2dx-db in the same parent folder. 

I put some common code to https://github.com/stubma/cocos2dx-common, so also clone it in the same parent folder.
The cocos2dx-common is referred by all my cocos2d-x extensions.

Demo
===========
There is a test project in test folder, it supports iOS and android.

NOTE
===========
In cocos2dx-common, some basic features are not implemented for Windows. If you are a Windows guy, do it yourself 
and good luck.

How to use
===========
For iOS, just drag cocos2dx-db project into your project. For Android, just import cocos2dx-db module. If not clear, 
refer to demo code.
